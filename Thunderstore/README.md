# Tick-Be-Gone

This is a simple accessibilty mod that adds tweaks for the tick item to make the game more accessible to people with arachnophobia or who are otherwise squeamish around bugs.
Replaces the tick with a pink sphere by default, but see the config for options.

**Only the model is changed, hitbox and behavior remains identical.**
